            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Oluwaseyi Adedotun.
                My School ID is ALT/SOE/023/2415.
                I'm in ALT School to upskill andd learn Software Engineering with a focus on Frontend web development
                technologies.
                I am currently a product designer so I believe learning front end development will further boost my
                skills
                and get me more involved in the product creation process.
            </p>
